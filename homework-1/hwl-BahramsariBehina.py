# Homework Assignment 1: <Variables, Input/Output>
#
# Description:
# <A Hospital reporting system to provide a quick overview of the patientâ€™s condition
# by collecting patient's name, weight, height, and specific lab test results related to genetic mutations.
# Assumes that the user provides input in the correct format.
# the report displays the patient's name, calculated BMI based on weight and height, and results for genetic mutations.>
